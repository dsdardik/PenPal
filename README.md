# PenPal
PenPal is a Facebook chatbot that anonymously pairs Facebook friends in Messenger by relaying messages. Curious if you can tell who your friends are just by having a conversation? Ever wonder how well you connect with friends you don't many opportunites to converse with? Start using PenPal to find out!

PenPal is a back-end server application written in Node.js.

## Getting Started
A Facebook account is required to use PenPal. Start by sending a message to the PenPal chatbot. PenPal can be found in the discover section of Facebook Messenger by searching "PenPal". 

## How it works
Send and receive messages to the chatbot account as you would do with any person. PenPal receives your message and randomly pairs you with someone in your friends list to have an anonymous conversation. It relays your messages so you only appear to be talking to the chatbot. You can remain anonymous, or when you're ready, choose to reveal yourselves.
